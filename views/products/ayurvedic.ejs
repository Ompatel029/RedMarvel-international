        <strong>About Psyllium Seeds:</strong>
        Psyllium Seeds, commonly known as <em>Isabgol</em>, are widely used for their high dietary fiber content.
        They help improve digestion, relieve constipation, and support gut health.
        Psyllium also aids in weight management and helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
